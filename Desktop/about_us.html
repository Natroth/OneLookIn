		The single most difficult thing for an aspiring musician to do is to find a platform to express him/herself. It is that crucial experience where one can experiment, meet friends and find one's true voice. Unfortunately, traditional social media sites are simply not built for musicians.   <br> <br>
	
		&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Lynxic is a social network developed by musicians, for musicians. It is the perfect platform for an artist to connect with other like-minded musicians and fans. Once <a href="register.php" style="color: #13A380"> registered and logged in</a>, you will have the ability to upload a post with audio, text and a genre. The system will automatically upload the song to your home page, the specific genre group entered, and a site-wide leader board. See a song you like? Save it to your personal 'Saved' page for future listening or share it with friends. And, like any social media site, you will interact with other musicians and reach out to fans through advanced messaging and commenting systems.<br><br>

		&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp I truly believe that every musician and audiophile will have a place on this site and will be able to contribute to the community. Rock on! <br><br><br>
